","""Welcome! Let's take a closer look at this print, 'A triple waterfall, a dead tree at right, a mountain and a herd of cows in the background at right, plate 7 from ""Roman landscapes and ruins""'.

This etching is attributed to both Stefano della Bella and François Langlois. Della Bella was an Italian artist from Florence, living from 1610 to 1664, while Langlois was a French publisher, baptized in Chartres in 1588 and passed away in Paris in 1647. Della Bella likely created the original artwork, and Langlois published it as part of a series of Roman landscapes.

Created around 1646, within a period spanning 1641 to 1651, this print is part of a larger series called ""Roman Landscapes and Ruins."" As the title and tags suggest, the artwork beautifully depicts a picturesque scene featuring waterfalls, mountains, trees,"

","""Welcome! Let's take a closer look at this print by the celebrated Spanish artist Francisco de Goya. Goya, born in Fuendetodos, Spain in 1746 and passed away in Bordeaux, France, in 1828, was a hugely influential figure in art history, bridging the gap between the Old Masters and modern art.

This piece, titled ""Thou who canst not (Tu que no puedes),"" is Plate 42 from his series ""Los Caprichos,"" created in 1799. The ""Caprichos"" were a set of satirical prints addressing the social and political ills of late 18th-century Spain. As you can see from the title and the tags, men and donkeys appear in the composition, likely serving as metaphors for societal failings and highlighting themes of ineptitude and perhaps the burden of those who are incapable.

","Good morning! Welcome to the gallery. Let's take a closer look at this intriguing little photograph, ""Card Number 620, Laura Wood, from the Actors and Actresses series.""

This piece dates back to the 1880s, a time when advertising was undergoing significant innovation. It's not technically a work by a single artist, but rather produced by W. Duke, Sons & Co., an American publisher based in both New York and Durham, North Carolina, active from around 1870 to 1920. You might recognize the name; they were a major tobacco company known for promoting Cross Cut Cigarettes.

The card is an albumen photograph, a popular process at the time known for its sharp details and glossy finish. Its classification as both a photograph and ""ephemera"" tells us that it was originally intended as a disposable, everyday item. The subject matter is clear – it's a portrait of Laura Wood,"

As the title suggests and the tag confirms, the subject is Hercules, the legendary hero from classical mythology.

","""Welcome! Let me draw your attention to this powerful print titled 'Pilate Washing His Hands, from ""The Passion.""' It was created in 1512 by Albrecht Dürer, one of the most renowned artists of the Northern Renaissance.

Dürer was a German artist, born in Nuremberg in 1471 and active there until his death in 1528. He was a master of various media, but particularly celebrated for his printmaking.

","""Welcome! Let's take a closer look at this fascinating wallpaper design.

This drawing, titled ""Design for wallpaper featuring blue shields surmounted by crowns,"" offers a glimpse into the world of 19th-century decorative arts. It was created collaboratively by two French artists: Jules-Edmond-Charles Lachaise, who died in 1897, and Eugène-Pierre Gourdet, born in Paris in 1820 and passing away in 1889. As you can see from their lifespans, this design was created sometime between 1830 and 1897, a period of significant change and innovation in design and manufacturing.

The subject matter, blue shields topped with crowns, suggests a potential commission for a wallpaper intended for a space evoking nobility or a sense of grandeur. Although there are no specific tags to help us understand more about the intention behind the design, the very image itself speaks to a certain era and"

This title page, part of a book aimed at noble and honest women (""Nobili Et Honeste Matrone""), is significant because it offers insights into the education and ideals promoted for women of the time. The presence of a coat of arms suggests a connection to a specific noble family, further emphasizing its intended audience.

Goya, born in 1746 and died in 1828, was a master painter and printmaker. As you can see from his dates, he lived through a period of great upheaval in Spain. This print, ""Plate 78 from 'The Disasters of War': 'He defends himself well',"" part of a larger series, directly reflects the horrors of the Peninsular War between Spain and France, which took place between 1808 and 1814. Although the print itself was created between 1814 and 1815, it wasn’t actually published until 1863, well after Goya’s death.

The series as a whole offers a stark and unflinching look at the brutality of war, moving beyond the typical heroic depictions of the time. This particular image,"

","""Welcome! Let's take a closer look at this delicate drawing entitled 'Madonna and Child.'

This piece is attributed to Alonso Cano, a prominent Spanish artist from Granada, who lived from 1601 to 1667. As you can see from the title and the tag, the drawing depicts the Madonna and Child, a very common and important subject in religious art, particularly during the period this piece likely originates from, somewhere between 1600 and 1850.

The artwork is a drawing created with pen and dark brown ink on tan paper, which has been cut into a charming oval shape. The meticulous use of ink lines reveals Cano's skill as a draughtsman.

This is ""Susanna Accused of Adultery, from The Story of Susanna,"" a print created in 1555 by the German artist Heinrich Aldegrever. Aldegrever was from Paderborn, Germany, born around 1502 and lived until sometime between 1555 and 1561. He was active during the Northern Renaissance, a time when artists were heavily influenced by classical themes and humanist ideals.

The title, ""Susanna Accused of Adultery,"" along with the tags ""Men"" and ""Women,"" tells us that the artwork depicts a scene from the biblical story of Susanna. This story, found in the Book of Daniel, recounts how Susanna was falsely accused of adultery by two lecherous elders.

","""Welcome! Let's take a look at this fascinating print, ""Cupid and an Eagle."" This etching was created in 1652. The Metropolitan Museum of Art holds this piece.

We have two artists attributed to this artwork: Wenceslaus Hollar and Giulio Romano. The Bohemian artist, Wenceslaus Hollar, born in Prague in 1607 and died in London in 1677, is listed as the etcher. Giulio Romano was born in Rome, Italy around 1499 and died in Mantua in 1546. 

The subject matter is quite intriguing: Cupid, the Roman god of love, juxtaposed with an eagle, a powerful symbol often associated with strength and empires. You'll notice it's tagged with 'Eagles,' 'Cupid,' and 'Bowls' suggesting these are key elements to consider. This interplay of the god of love with such a powerful image is quite"

","Good morning! Let's take a look at this intriguing little print titled ""'Der's a stunt for yer,'"" from the ""Terrors of America"" set.

This print dates from 1888 to 1889, a period when the W. Duke, Sons & Co., tobacco company, based in both New York and Durham, North Carolina, was heavily engaged in promotional efforts. W. Duke, Sons & Co. was the publisher. The lithography was done by Knapp & Company. Both were American firms. W. Duke, Sons & Co. produced a variety of promotional items during this time and this print reflects that.

The title ""Terrors of America"" and the tag ""Boys"" suggests that this series likely depicted adventurous or mischievous young boys. The phrase ""'Der's a stunt for yer'"" implies that the image itself portrays a daring feat or prank. It offers a small glimpse into late 19th-century American boyhood and"

","""Welcome! Let's take a look at this intriguing drawing.

This is a design titled 'Design for Phaeton, no. 543,' created by Brewster & Co., an American manufacturer from New York. Dating from between 1850 and 1874, it falls within a period of significant industrial and technological advancement in America, especially concerning transportation.

","Welcome! Let's take a closer look at this fascinating drawing.

What we have here is a design for an altar, titled ""Design for an Altar: Virgin and Child Flanked by Saints, Two Angels in the Left and Right Foreground."" It's a drawing, meaning it's primarily intended as a preliminary sketch for a larger, perhaps grander, artwork.

Now, the artwork is currently attributed to an anonymous Italian artist working in either the 17th or 18th century. We know this because the object dates are listed as 1600-1800, while the artist lived and worked between 1600 and 1799, thus the drawing was produced sometime within that period. Because the artist is anonymous, we can't speak to specific context, but we can get a feel for the general time period and nationality.

The title, along with the 'Animals' and 'Children' tags, suggests the artwork depicts personifications of the three continents – America, Asia, and Europe – likely represented through symbolic figures, perhaps with children and animals that were thought to be representative of those regions. Allegorical representations like these were very common in the 18th century as a way to visually convey complex ideas about different parts of the world.

During this time, printmaking flourished, allowing for the widespread dissemination of artistic ideas and designs.

","Alright, welcome! Let's take a look at this fascinating piece.

This is a photograph titled ""Lydia Yeamans, from the Actors and Actresses series (N171) for Old Judge Cigarettes."" It was published by Goodwin & Company, sometime between 1886 and 1890. While we don't know Goodwin & Company's exact background or nationality from this information alone, their association with Old Judge Cigarettes places them firmly within the burgeoning advertising industry of the late 19th century. We can see that they were active between 1850 and 1950.

As the title and tags suggest, the subject is Lydia Yeamans, an actress. These ""Actors and Actresses"" cards were popular ephemera, a kind of collectible, often included in cigarette packs as a marketing tactic.

The photograph itself is an albumen print, a popular photographic process at the time. Albumen"

","Alright, let's take a closer look at this drawing.

This piece is titled ""Christ and the Children"" and it's a drawing from the 17th century, falling roughly between the years 1600 and 1700. What's particularly interesting is that the artist is currently listed as ""Anonymous, Italian, Roman-Bolognese"" from that same period. This means the artist likely came from the region encompassing Rome and Bologna, which were significant centers for art during the Baroque era. It's not uncommon for works from this time to have unknown authorship.

The subject matter, as the title and tags suggest, depicts Christ interacting with children. This is a common theme in Christian art, often representing innocence, humility, and the importance of welcoming children into the faith. The presence of men and women amongst the figures further emphasizes a broader audience and community around Christ.

It’s a collaborative work: François Boucher, born in Paris in 1703 and died in 1770, created the original design.

","Alright, let's take a look at this intriguing print. This is ""The Turkish Family"" by Albrecht Dürer, a renowned German artist from Nuremberg. He lived from 1471 to 1528, placing him squarely in the Northern Renaissance.

This print, created around 1496, falls between 1491 and 1501. As you can see from the title and the tags, it depicts a family, specifically labeled as ""Turkish."" You’ll notice the man carries a bow and arrow. During this period, depictions of other cultures, particularly those from the Ottoman Empire, were becoming more common in European art, reflecting a growing awareness of the world beyond their borders. Dürer, like many artists of his time, was fascinated by different cultures and sought to represent them in his work.

The piece itself is an engraving, a type of printmaking. Dürer was a master of this technique."

The artist, or rather the publisher, is Allen & Ginter, an American company from Richmond, Virginia. They were active between 1885 and 1891, which is when this particular series of cards was produced. While we don't have specific dates for the individuals involved in Allen & Ginter, their American origins and location in Richmond provide some context.

","Good morning! Welcome, I'd like to draw your attention to this compelling print: Jacques Callot's ""La Condamnation a Mort (The Condemnation to Death), from La Grande Passion (The Large Passion).""

It dates back to around 1888, placing it squarely in the late Victorian era. What's interesting is that it’s from a set of cards produced by Allen & Ginter, an American company based in Richmond, Virginia. They were a publisher, not necessarily photographers, and they created these cards to include in packs of Virginia Brights Cigarettes. So, consider this a very early form of advertising and collectible trading card.

The artist, John Hamilton Mortimer, was a British artist born in Eastbourne in 1740 and sadly died quite young in London in 1779. Despite his short life, he was a prolific artist, and this print gives us a glimpse into his interests.

The title and the presence of the 'Spears' and 'Men' tags suggest that the subject matter is a banditti, or bandit, taking up his position, likely in a rural or perhaps even a theatrical setting, given the era. The late 18th century was a time of significant social and political upheaval, and images of bandits, romanticized or not, were quite popular.
