","Welcome! Let's take a look at this powerful print by Francisco de Goya, specifically Plate 11 from his series ""The Disasters of War,"" titled ""Neither do these"" or ""Ni por esas"" in Spanish.

Goya was a Spanish artist, born in 1746 and passed away in 1828, with a long and impactful career spanning various political upheavals. This print, created around 1810, is part of a series reflecting the brutal realities of the Peninsular War, which saw Spain invaded and occupied by Napoleonic forces from around 1808 to 1814. The series as a whole is a searing indictment of war's inhumanity.

Looking at the tags - Soldiers, Infants, Men, Women - and the title, you can see the devastating impact of conflict on civilian populations. “Neither do these” implies that not even the most vulnerable—infants—are spared the horrors of war. Goya doesn't shy away from portraying the raw, unvarnished truth.

Technically, this print is a ""working proof,"" meaning it was likely pulled while Goya was still developing the plate. It's a combination of etching, drypoint, and burin, all intaglio techniques where the image is incised into a metal plate. The plate itself is relatively small, about 6 by 8 inches, while the sheet is around 8 by 12 inches.

""The Disasters of War"" is a significant series because it departs from traditional heroic depictions of war. Goya shows us the suffering, the violence, and the moral decay that accompanies armed conflict. This print, along with the rest of the series, offers a stark and enduring reminder of war's devastating consequences. You can find this particular print, and many others from the series, here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Any questions?

","""Welcome! Let's take a look at this intriguing print: *Die Propheten alle Deudsch*, or *The Prophets All in German*. It was created in 1541 by Lucas Cranach the Younger and his workshop. Cranach the Younger was a German artist born in Wittenberg in 1515 and he lived until 1586, so this work comes from relatively early in his career. He was a prominent figure in the Wittenberg artistic scene, following in his father's footsteps.

Being a print, and specifically a woodcut, it was intended for wider distribution – allowing for mass production of images during the Reformation. The title suggests a focus on the prophets, and the tags ""Men,"" ""Women,"" and ""Female Nudes"" hint that these figures are depicted, perhaps in scenes from the Old Testament. The inclusion of female nudes was not uncommon at the time, even in religious contexts, and often served allegorical purposes.

Considering the date, 1541, it's important to remember that this was a period of immense religious upheaval in Europe. The Reformation, spearheaded by Martin Luther, was in full swing. Given the title, translating to 'The Prophets All in German,' it is highly likely that this print is associated with the rise of Protestantism and the importance of reading the Bible in the vernacular – in this case, German.

Technically, the piece is a woodcut, a relief printing technique where the artist carves an image into a block of wood, leaving the raised areas to be inked and printed. This particular print measures approximately 11 13/16 by 8 3/16 inches. You can see it here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, in the Drawings and Prints Department. Its presence here speaks to its artistic and historical significance.""

","""Welcome! This print, titled 'Saint Roch,' is a fascinating piece from 1756. It's an etching and engraving, which are printmaking techniques allowing for detailed lines and tonal variations. We can see the collaboration here – the publisher was Joseph Wagner, an Italian from Thalendorf who lived from 1706 to 1780, operating out of Venice. The artist who created the actual image was Francesco Bartolozzi, another Italian, born in Florence in 1728 and passed away in Lisbon in 1815.

Saint Roch, the subject of this print, was a Catholic saint known as the protector against plagues and epidemics. Given the date, 1756, disease and fears surrounding it would have been prevalent, making Saint Roch a significant figure for prayer and devotion.

The print itself is relatively small, about 9 and 5/16 inches tall and 6 and 7/16 inches wide. It’s a wonderful example of the kind of devotional imagery that circulated during the mid-18th century, using etching and engraving to make it more widely accessible. You can find this print here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.""

The publisher, the American Tobacco Company, specifically W. Duke, Sons & Co., was based in New York and Durham, North Carolina. They were active between 1870 and 1920, as you can see by the date range. This photograph itself was created around 1891, placing it firmly in the late 19th century.

As the title and tags suggest, the photograph is a portrait of Mlle. Deanville, an actress. It was part of a larger series used as promotional material for Duke Cigarettes. This type of advertising was very common during this period. These cards, featuring actresses and other notable figures, were inserted into cigarette packs as a collectible incentive.

The photograph is an albumen print, a popular photographic process in the late 19th century. Notice how small it is, only about 2 11/16 × 1 3/8 inches (6.8 × 3.5 cm). Despite its size, it offers a glimpse into the world of entertainment and advertising during the late 1800s.

","Good morning! Welcome to this print, titled ""A Sailor's Observation on the Lamented Death of Lord Nelson.""

This hand-colored etching, created on December 3rd, 1805, is a collaboration between two British artists: George Murgatroyd Woodward (1765-1809) and Thomas Rowlandson (1757-1827), both based in London. Rowlandson is particularly known for his satirical works, and this piece aligns well with that.

The artwork, classified as a print, is quite insightful considering its creation shortly after the death of Lord Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805. While ostensibly lamenting his death, the ""Sailor's Observation"" suggests a more complicated reaction, as suggested by the tags: ""Men,"" ""Drinking,"" ""Sailors,"" and ""Satire."" We can infer that the print likely uses humor and perhaps even social commentary to explore the feelings of the common sailor regarding Nelson's death, rather than straightforward grief. It offers a glimpse into the public's perception, or perhaps misperceptions, of grief amongst sailors.

Technically, it's a hand-colored etching, which was a popular and relatively quick way to produce prints at the time, making them accessible to a wider audience. This particular impression measures 10 1/2 × 15 1/16 inches (sheet size), and you can find it here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I encourage you to take a closer look at the details and consider the contrasting emotions it evokes. Any questions?

","Alright, welcome! Let's take a look at this fascinating piece.

This is a baseball card, titled ""Peeples, Catcher, Brooklyn, from the Old Judge series (N172) for Old Judge Cigarettes"". It's an albumen photograph, placing it firmly within the realm of early photographic processes.

Now, Goodwin & Company, who are listed as the publisher, were active between 1850 and 1950, suggesting the company was active for an extensive period. This card itself was produced between 1887 and 1890, placing it right in the heart of the late 19th-century boom in baseball's popularity. These ""Old Judge"" cards, included in cigarette packs, were a major part of that burgeoning baseball culture.

You can see from the title and tags that it's a portrait of Peeples, a catcher for the Brooklyn team, and it clearly falls under the categories of ""Baseball"" and ""Athletes"". It's a glimpse into the early days of professional sports and how they were marketed.

The photograph itself is quite small, only about 2 11/16 by 1 3/8 inches – pocket-sized, perfect for collecting!

Currently, this piece is held in the Drawings and Prints Department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art right here in New York. It’s a relatively unassuming object, yet it tells a rich story about the history of baseball, photography, and consumer culture.

","""Welcome! Let's take a closer look at this print titled 'Fertilization of Egypt, from Erasmus Darwin's ""The Botanic Garden""'.

This engraving is a fascinating piece from 1791, a collaboration between several notable figures. The print is credited to three artists: Erasmus Darwin, William Blake, and Henry Fuseli, each bringing their unique talents to the table.

Erasmus Darwin, a British author who lived from 1731 to 1802, wrote ""The Botanic Garden,"" from which this image is derived. William Blake, the famous British artist (1757-1827), and Henry Fuseli, a Swiss-born artist (1741-1825) who spent much of his career in London, are both credited as artists. They likely translated Darwin's scientific and poetic concepts into visual form.

The title, 'Fertilization of Egypt,' suggests a symbolic representation, possibly linking natural processes of growth and abundance to the land of Egypt. This was a time of growing interest in the natural sciences and exploration, which is reflected in Darwin's work.

As an engraving, the print demonstrates the meticulous process of carving an image into a plate, likely copper, and then using ink to transfer it onto paper. This technique allowed for the creation of multiple copies, making the image accessible to a wider audience. The image itself is relatively small, measuring about 7 and 5/8 by 6 inches. The sheet size is slightly larger.

This intriguing print is part of the Drawings and Prints collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where it offers a glimpse into the artistic and scientific interests of the late 18th century.""

","Good morning! Welcome to this section of the gallery. Let's take a look at this intriguing piece: Albrecht Dürer's ""Saint Simon.""

Albrecht Dürer, as you can see from his bio, was a renowned German artist from Nuremberg, active from 1471 to 1528. He's considered one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance.

This particular artwork, titled ""Saint Simon,"" dates back to 1523, placing it firmly within Dürer's mature period. The tag ""Saints"" suggests this is a depiction of Saint Simon the Apostle, a figure from Christian tradition. It's fascinating to see how Dürer, drawing upon Renaissance ideals, portrayed religious figures with such detail and individual character.

The piece is an engraving, a type of printmaking. Dürer was a master of this technique, using a burin to carve lines into a metal plate, which was then inked and used to create the print. The classification confirms it as a print. It is a relatively small piece, measuring only about 4 9/16 × 2 15/16 inches.

This print of ""Saint Simon"" is currently housed here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where we can appreciate Dürer's skill and artistry up close. Any questions?

","Good morning! Welcome, and thank you for stopping by this print. Let's take a closer look at ""Jesus et la Cananéenne,"" or ""Jesus and the Canaanite Woman.""

This engraving, created between 1820 and 1857, resides within the Drawings and Prints Department. While the print is attributed to Hipolyte Lecomte and Jean Germain Drouais as the artists, it also involves the publishing house of Furne et Cie. and the printer, F. Chardon, Ainé. This collaborative effort was common in the 19th century for the dissemination of art.

Drouais, who lived from 1763 to 1788, and Lecomte (1781-1857) were both French artists. Lecomte was active until 1860. Therefore, we're looking at a piece that represents a visual interpretation of a Biblical story, rendered in a style that reflects the artistic sensibilities of the first half of the 19th century, yet still builds on the work of an earlier, late 18th century artist.

The artwork itself depicts a scene from the Bible, ""Jesus and the Canaanite Woman."" The engraving medium, along with its classification as a print, suggests it was intended for wider distribution.

The image measures approximately 5 9/16 by 3 15/16 inches, while the sheet it's printed on is a bit larger, at 10 13/16 by 7 5/8 inches. You can appreciate its details here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It offers us a glimpse into how religious narratives were visualized and disseminated through printmaking during this period in France.

","Good morning! Welcome to this intriguing print, ""Visit of a Clergyman to Bastide, Sausion, and Collard."" It's a lithograph dating from around 1825.

Let's consider the context. This print is attributed to Sébastien Coeuré, a French artist active in Paris from 1778 to 1831. He collaborated with Aaron Martinet, also French (1762-1841), who served as the publisher for this particular piece. Therefore, Coeuré likely created the image and Martinet oversaw its production and distribution.

The title suggests the subject matter: a clergyman's visit to individuals named Bastide, Sausion, and Collard. Unfortunately, we don’t have any specific tags providing more detail on the individuals, but the scene offers a glimpse into social interactions of the time.

The fact that this work is a lithograph is quite significant. Lithography, a relatively new printing technique at the time (invented in the late 18th century), allowed for a more painterly and less rigid aesthetic compared to earlier printing methods. It allowed for more detailed and nuanced imagery. The print itself is a relatively large one, measuring 11 1/2 × 17 1/8 inches.

This print, classified as a Print, gives us a visual window into early 19th-century France. You can see this artwork here with us in the Drawings and Prints Department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Any further questions?

","""Welcome! Let's take a look at this interesting piece. It's titled 'Fiori di Ricami Nuovamente Posti in Luce, page 6 (recto)' and is categorized as an Ornament & Architecture print, belonging to a book.

The artwork is a woodcut, a printmaking technique, and it comes from 1591, placing it firmly in the late 16th century. It measures about 5 1/2 by 7 7/8 inches, making it a rather intimate piece.

The designer was Matteo Florimi, an Italian artist active in Siena from around 1581 until his death in 1613. The publisher was Francesco de' Franceschi, another Italian artist active in the 16th century. Given the title, which translates to ""Embroidery Flowers Newly Brought to Light,"" and the 'Ornament' tag, we can infer that this page likely featured designs intended for embroidery patterns. These books were essential resources for artisans and ladies of the time. The very existence of such prints demonstrates the importance and artistic value placed on embroidery during this period.

It's a wonderful example of how art and craft were intertwined. You can find this very print here, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.""

","""Welcome! Let's take a look at this print titled 'A Nymph and Shepherd.'

This artwork is an engraving from 1775. You'll notice it's quite a collaborative piece. While the print itself is a 1775 engraving, we see four artists associated with it. John Boydell, a British publisher who lived from 1720 to 1804, likely commissioned and distributed this work. Carlo Cignani, an Italian artist from Bologna (1628-1719) was the artist of the original artwork, though he passed away before this engraving was made. George Farington, British (1752-1788), and Jean-Baptiste Michel, French (1748-1804), were the engravers who brought this to life in print form.

The subject matter, as the title suggests, depicts a nymph and a shepherd, a common theme in art throughout history often used to symbolize nature, love, and idyllic life. This makes it fit neatly within the artistic conventions of the late 18th century.

Engraving, the technique used here, involves cutting lines into a metal plate, inking the plate, and then pressing it onto paper. As you can see, it allows for very fine detail. The plate itself is about 12 by 14 inches (31.6 x 37.6 cm) while the sheet is 15 by 19 inches (40.4 x 50.7 cm). The detail and medium classify it as a Print.

","Good morning! Welcome to this display featuring a print from Giovanni Andrea Vavassore.

Vavassore was an Italian artist and publisher active in Venice between 1530 and 1573. This piece, created in 1530, is titled ""Opera Nova Universali intitulata Corona di racammi, page 3 (recto),"" which translates to ""New Universal Work Entitled Crown of Embroidery, page 3 (recto)."" As indicated by the title and the 'Ornament' tag, this print is essentially a pattern book, intended to provide inspiration and designs for embroidery.

This work is significant as it provides a glimpse into the decorative arts of the early 16th century. The print, classified as both a book and a print within the broader category of Ornament & Architecture, demonstrates the importance of pattern books in disseminating design ideas during this period.

Looking at the artwork itself, it is a woodcut, a relatively accessible printmaking technique that allowed for wider distribution of these designs. The overall size is 8 7/8 x 6 7/8 inches (22.5 x 17.5 cm). This specific print is part of the collection here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. I hope you find it interesting!

","Good morning! Welcome to this fascinating album from our Drawings and Prints department.

What we have here is a scrapbook titled ""Scrapbook Containing Italian Etchings of the 17th and 18th Centuries."" While we don't know the specific artist or artists responsible for compiling this album, it offers a wonderful glimpse into the artistic styles and common themes prevalent in Italy during those two centuries.

As you can see from the tags, the album features a variety of subjects, including landscapes, men, dogs, trees, cows, musical instruments such as flutes, and scenes related to music. These subjects reflect the interests and preoccupations of the time. The album’s prints may depict scenes of daily life, allegorical representations, or idealized pastoral settings – all popular themes in Italian art of the period.

The “Object Date” tells us this album was created between the 17th and 18th centuries, a period of significant artistic development in Italy, encompassing late Baroque and early Neoclassical styles. The medium used is etching, a printmaking technique that involves using acid to corrode a design into a metal plate, which is then inked and used to create multiple impressions. As the classification indicates, this object is both an ""Album"" and consists of ""Prints"". The original dimensions are not provided, but it's housed right here in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

This album, therefore, is a valuable record of Italian artistic expression during this time, offering insight into the aesthetic preferences and cultural values of the 17th and 18th centuries through the art of etching. Take your time to examine the details and appreciate the skill and artistry involved in creating these captivating scenes.

","""Welcome! Let's take a look at this fascinating photograph titled 'Miss Eamel, from the Actors and Actresses series (N45, Type 8) for Virginia Brights Cigarettes.'

This photograph, dating from around 1888, is a product of the American publisher, Allen & Ginter, a company based in Richmond, Virginia. While we don't have exact birth and death dates for Allen & Ginter as artists, they were active between 1885 and 1891. They were well-known for producing collectible cards, like this one, inserted into cigarette packs.

The subject matter, as the title suggests, is Miss Eamel, likely a stage actress of the time. The tags 'Portraits,' 'Women,' and 'Actresses' confirm this. These ""Actors and Actresses"" series were incredibly popular, reflecting the growing fascination with celebrity culture in the late 19th century.

Technically, this is an albumen photograph, a common photographic process of the era, which gives it that distinct look. It’s considered both a photograph and a piece of ephemera, meaning it was intended for short-term use but now holds historical significance.

Notice how small it is, only about 2 5/8 x 1 1/2 inches. Despite its size, it provides a glimpse into the advertising and entertainment trends of the late 1880s. You can see this photograph and many other wonderful artworks at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.""

","""Welcome! Let's take a closer look at this fascinating print.

This piece, titled ""Bearded man with chain necklace,"" is an etching from 1647. The artist is either Wenceslaus Hollar or Hans Holbein the Younger.

**If the Artist is Wenceslaus Hollar**
We believe it's likely by Wenceslaus Hollar, a Bohemian artist born in Prague in 1607 and who died in London in 1677. Hollar was a prolific etcher, known for his detailed and meticulous work.

**If the Artist is Hans Holbein the Younger**
We believe it's likely by Hans Holbein the Younger, a German artist, born in Augsburg in either 1497 or 1498, and who died in London in 1543. Holbein was well known for painting portraits of royalty and other prominent figures in the 16th century.

The print depicts a bearded man in profile, wearing a chain necklace. As the tag suggests, its subject matter centers around men. The fact that this is the third state of three etching proofs means the plate used to create the print was reworked at least twice by the artist. Its believed to have been part of a larger collection of original etchings.

Etching, the technique used here, is a printmaking process where acid is used to etch into a metal plate, creating the image. You can appreciate the fine lines and details that Hollar or Holbein achieved through this technique. The print itself is relatively small, with the plate measuring about 4 1/4 by 3 inches.

This particular impression is considered a ""late impression,"" which indicates it was printed after the initial, more desirable prints were made. This print, a testament to the skill of either Hollar or Holbein, resides here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.""

Meyer used graphite to create this drawing, a common medium for sketches and studies during this period.

","Alright, welcome! Let's take a look at this fascinating little photograph.

This is ""Gladdy Virvian, from the Actresses series (N245)"" issued by Kinney Brothers Tobacco Company to promote their Sweet Caporal Cigarettes. The Kinney Brothers Tobacco Company was an American publisher, active between 1869 and 2011, as their brand continued to be marketed long after their original business.

You see, during the late 19th century – this particular piece dates to 1890 – companies often used images of popular figures like actresses to advertise their products. These were often included as collectible inserts inside cigarette packs. As indicated by the title and the tags ""Portraits,"" ""Women,"" and ""Actresses,"" this is a portrait of the actress Gladdy Virvian.

It's an albumen photograph, a popular photographic process at the time, classified as both a photograph and ephemera. Ephemera because these cards were meant to be temporary and disposable, part of a larger marketing campaign. It's quite small, only about 2 1/2 by 1 7/16 inches, so imagine holding a tiny piece of Victorian celebrity in your hand.

As the title and tags suggest, the subject of this print is Saint John the Evangelist, one of the twelve apostles of Jesus and traditionally considered the author of the Gospel of John.

Now, what makes this piece particularly interesting is its medium. It's an etching, created using a technique where acid is used to bite into a metal plate to create the lines. What's even more unique is that Schiavone has used yellowy green ink for the etching itself, and then added details using white gouache and a yellow wash. This adds a very distinctive, almost ethereal quality to the image. Prints like this were becoming increasingly popular during this time as a way to disseminate images and ideas.

","""Welcome! Let's take a closer look at this captivating drawing by Pieter Moninckx titled ""Pyramid of Cestius and the Porta San Paolo, Rome.""

Pieter Moninckx was a Dutch artist, born in The Hague in 1606 and believed to have passed away around 1686. While we don't know a precise death date, this drawing, created sometime between 1620 and 1690, places it firmly in the 17th century, a period when Dutch artists frequently traveled to Italy, particularly Rome, to study classical architecture and landscapes.

As the title suggests, Moninckx meticulously captured the Pyramid of Cestius and the Porta San Paolo, two iconic Roman landmarks. The tags confirm this: we see a clear depiction of both a pyramid and the city gates of Rome. This interest in antiquity was a hallmark of the period, reflecting a renewed appreciation for classical art and architecture.

Moninckx used a combination of brush and brown ink over black chalk, with a framing line in pen and black ink, to create this detailed representation.

","""Welcome! Let's take a look at this intriguing print. This is titled 'Libanon, from the Dancing Girls of the World series (N185)' and was published in 1889 by William S. Kimball & Company, who were a publisher rather than an artist in the traditional sense. This piece is part of the Drawings and Prints department.

As you can see from the title and tags – 'Dancing Girls,' 'Women,' 'Dancing,' 'Profiles' – the artwork is a depiction of a dancer, likely intended to represent someone from Lebanon, given the title. It’s important to remember that this was a commercial print, so the artist and publisher's interpretation and representation of Lebanon may be filtered through a Western lens of the late 19th century.

The year 1889 places this work squarely in the late Victorian era. The fact that it was produced as a commercial color lithograph suggests it was intended for mass production, likely as a collectible insert in cigarette packages or similar products. These small prints, measuring just 2 11/16 × 1 1/2 inches, were a popular form of ephemera at the time.

You can find this particular example housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It provides a fascinating glimpse into both the artistry and commercial culture of the late 19th century and how other cultures were portrayed and consumed at the time.""

","""Welcome! Let's take a closer look at this intriguing print.

This piece, titled 'Royalist trompe l'oeil,' comes to us from 18th-century France. We know this because the artist, although anonymous, is identified as French and working during that time. This means they were creating art during a period of significant political and social upheaval in France, leading up to the French Revolution.

The title, combined with the tags 'Architecture' and 'Trees,' suggests a scene that cleverly blends architectural elements with natural imagery, employing the 'trompe l'oeil' technique, which aims to deceive the viewer into believing they are seeing a real, three-dimensional scene. The ""Royalist"" aspect implies that the architecture may symbolize the monarchy.

Being classified as a print and specifically an 'Engraving' within 'Ornament & Architecture,' tells us about the artistic method used. Engraving is an intaglio printmaking process where lines are incised into a metal plate, which is then inked and pressed onto paper. This would have allowed for multiple copies of the artwork to be made and distributed, potentially for decorative or propagandistic purposes.

You can see that it's a relatively small work. The sheet itself is only about 5 3/8 by 4 5/16 inches, with the image being even smaller.

This artwork is currently part of the collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It's a fascinating example of how artists in the 18th century combined technical skill with symbolic imagery.""

","""Welcome! Let's take a closer look at this intriguing piece, 'Gopsmor Cottage,' by Anders Zorn.

Zorn was a highly regarded Swedish artist, born in Mora in 1860 and who lived until 1920. Knowing he was from Mora, Sweden adds context because Gopsmor Cottage was Zorn's own summer home in Dalarna, Sweden, and the figures in the print are likely connected to his life there. This piece, created in 1917, towards the end of his life, offers a glimpse into his personal life and rural surroundings during that period. The tags – 'Human Figures' and 'Houses' – immediately draw our attention to the scene's core elements: a dwelling and its inhabitants, suggesting a domestic narrative.

Technically, this is an etching, specifically the third state of three, which means Zorn revisited the plate, making alterations for different versions of the print. The etching process itself involves using acid to create lines on a metal plate, which are then inked and printed. You can appreciate the detail he achieved using this method.

'Gopsmor Cottage' is a relatively intimate work; the plate measures approximately 7 7/8 by 5 7/8 inches, while the sheet it's printed on is around 15 13/16 by 11 15/16 inches. It falls under the classification of 'Prints,' and you can view it right here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.""

This piece is an etching, a type of printmaking, and is classified as belonging to the categories of Prints, Ornament & Architecture, and Albums. It measures about 8 7/16 by 13 3/4 inches.

It was printed around 1750 to 1756, a period of ornate design and architectural innovation. We know this album print originates from the mid-18th century, showing designs for ceiling decorations in the style of the time. The presence of 'cartouches' in the tags points to the decorative framing and scrollwork that were popular features of ceiling designs.

The print is a collaborative effort. Martin Engelbrecht, a German publisher from Augsburg (1684-1756), published it. The artist and engraver was Jeremias Wachsmuth, another German artist (1712-1771).

You can find this print here at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, within the Department of Drawings and Prints. It's a wonderful example of the kinds of designs circulating during that era, inspiring artisans and architects alike.""

","""Welcome! Let's take a look at this fascinating print. This is titled 'Entry of the Prince of Saxony with his Wife into Dresden on September 2, 1719, after their Marriage in Vienna'. It was created around 1700-1755 and is a collaboration between Adolf van der Laan and Pieter Schenck II.

Adolf van der Laan, the artist, was Dutch, born in Amsterdam in 1693 and lived until 1775. Pieter Schenck II acted as the publisher and was also Dutch. So, we see this print emerges from a strong Dutch artistic tradition of the 18th century.

As the title suggests, the subject matter depicts a significant event: the ceremonial entry of the Prince of Saxony and his wife into Dresden following their marriage in Vienna in 1719. You can see this reflected in the tags, which include horses, soldiers, carriages and men, which all give a clue to the grandeur of the occasion.

Technically, this piece is an etching, printed in a lovely red-brown ink. This places it firmly within the category of 'Prints' and also 'Ornament & Architecture,' suggesting it may have served as a decorative piece or even an architectural record. It’s a relatively small sheet, measuring about 6 3/8 x 7 3/16 inches.

","Welcome! Let's take a look at this fascinating little print.

This is a commercial color lithograph titled ""Common Time March, from the Parasol Drills series (N18) for Allen & Ginter Cigarettes Brands,"" dating back to 1888. That puts it squarely within the late Victorian era.

Now, notice the artist information: we see Allen & Ginter, who were the publishers, and Schumacher & Ettlinger, the lithographers. Allen & Ginter were an American company based in Richmond, Virginia, and Schumacher & Ettlinger were based in New York. Both were active in the 19th century, fitting within our artist begin and end dates of 1800 and 1900.

The artwork is part of the ""Parasol Drills"" series, and the title ""Common Time March"" coupled with the tag ""Women"" suggests it depicts a synchronized marching performance, perhaps with parasols, a popular form of entertainment and display during this time. The fact that it was used for Allen & Ginter Cigarettes Brands signifies its role as *ephemera*, that is, a collectible item meant to be discarded after its initial use, specifically as a promotional insert within cigarette packs. These types of cards were hugely popular and give us a glimpse into the marketing techniques of the era.

Looking at the *medium*, the commercial color lithograph process allowed for mass production of affordable and visually appealing images, perfect for this type of promotional material. It's quite small, only about 2 3/4 x 1 1/2 inches (7 x 3.8 cm).

You can find this interesting piece of American commercial art history here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It's a small but telling artifact of its time!

William S. Kimball & Co. were publishers, rather than artists in the traditional sense. They specialized in these kinds of collectible cards.

","Good morning! Welcome to this fascinating print, ""L'Amour et les Graces Arrivant de Londres; Le Suprême Bon-Ton No. 24.""

This piece was created in 1815 and falls under the category of prints, specifically an etching that has been beautifully hand-colored. It's a collaborative effort. Adrien Pierre Godefroy, Le Jeune, the artist (French, 1777–1865) created the image, while Aaron Martinet (French, 1762–1841) served as the publisher.

Given the title and tags like ""Caricature,"" ""Boys,"" ""Women,"" and ""Fashion,"" we can see this print is likely a satirical commentary on the arrival of love, graces and perhaps new fashion trends from London. Remember, 1815 is the year of the Congress of Vienna, marking the end of the Napoleonic Wars and a period of significant social and political shifts in Europe. This artwork could be a humorous reflection of the cultural exchange and influence flowing between France and England at that time.

The artists chose etching, a printmaking technique, and added hand-coloring which brings vibrancy and emphasizes certain details, drawing the viewer's eye to the satirical elements.

This particular print, measuring approximately 8 1/8 x 10 11/16 inches (20.7 x 27.2 cm), is part of the Drawings and Prints collection here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It's a small but insightful window into the social commentary of early 19th-century France.

","Welcome! Let's take a closer look at this intriguing little piece. This print, titled ""Card Number 165, Miss Fuller, from the Actors and Actresses series (N145-2),"" offers us a fascinating glimpse into late 19th-century American advertising and popular culture.

It was created in the 1880s by W. Duke, Sons & Co., an American publisher based in both New York and Durham, North Carolina, during a period of rapid industrialization and burgeoning consumerism. Duke, Sons & Co. were active from 1870 to 1920, and became well-known for their aggressive marketing of tobacco products.

As you can see from the title and the tags, the subject is ""Miss Fuller,"" an actress. This image is part of a larger series of ""Actors and Actresses"" cards, specifically the N145-2 set, that Duke, Sons & Co. distributed to promote their Cross Cut Cigarettes. The use of celebrities to endorse products was already a popular tactic back then.

The artwork itself is an albumen photograph, a common photographic process during that era, classified under Photographs and Ephemera. This particular print is quite small, measuring only about 2 5/8 by 1 7/16 inches, making it a collectable insert within a cigarette pack.

This piece provides valuable insights into the ways businesses used celebrity culture and photographic reproduction to market their products, offering a small but telling window into the entertainment and commercial landscape of the late 19th century. You can find this print here, in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

","""Welcome! Let's take a closer look at this fascinating drawing.

This piece, titled ""Design for a Sofa Back Cover (?) with an Ornamental Frame Containing a Large Horizontal Garland of Flowers and Leaves with Musical Instruments and a Vase, Decorated with Acanthus Leaves and Two Fleurs de Lys,"" is attributed to an anonymous French designer working in the 19th century, specifically between 1870 and 1900, as indicated by the object's date. The artist's active years fall within 1800 and 1900.

We can see that this is a meticulously detailed design for a decorative element, likely intended for a sofa. The subject matter showcases the typical ornate aesthetic of the period, with a rich garland of flowers and leaves, musical instruments, and a vase, all framed by elaborate acanthus leaves and fleurs-de-lys, popular motifs in French design. The question mark in the title suggests some uncertainty about its exact application.

Being created between 1870 and 1900, this drawing reflects the artistic movements of the late 19th century, potentially influenced by the lingering effects of the Rococo revival or the rise of Art Nouveau.

The artist used watercolor, a favored medium for creating detailed designs and illustrations, as classified under ""Drawings and Ornament & Architecture"". It allowed for delicate washes of color and precise linework, capturing the intricate details of the intended ornament.

You can appreciate the level of detail within the dimensions of the sheet, which measures 8 3/4 × 14 7/16 inches (22.2 × 36.6 cm).

Currently, this drawing resides in the Drawings and Prints department of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where it is preserved for study and appreciation.""

","""Welcome! Let's take a look at this fascinating book from the 18th century, titled ""Premiere Suite de Vases."" It’s currently housed here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

The artist, Duplessis Fils, was a French artist and publisher working during the 18th century. We can see the artwork itself dates from between 1700 and 1800, which places it squarely within that era.

The title, combined with the tags ""Vases,"" ""Putti,"" and ""Goats,"" suggests we're looking at a collection of vase designs, likely embellished with playful depictions of putti (those chubby cherubic figures) and perhaps scenes incorporating goats, which were often used as decorative elements in classical and neo-classical art.

This is an example of an etching, a printmaking technique, published as part of a book. The book itself measures roughly 15 13/16 x 11 7/16 inches. It’s classified as a book containing such etchings. So, in essence, it's a collection of prints intended to showcase designs and motifs popular during the 18th century. This type of publication would have been used as inspiration for artists, craftsmen, and patrons looking to incorporate these decorative elements into their own work.""

","""Good morning! Let's take a look at this intriguing print. This is 'S. Bernadin, de Sienne (St. Bernardine of Siena), May 20th,' from Jacques Callot's series 'Les Images De Tous Les Saincts et Saintes de L'Année,' printed in 1636.

Jacques Callot, the artist, was a prominent French printmaker from Nancy, born in 1592 and sadly passed away just a year before this print was made, in 1635. He was a master of etching, and this piece is a fine example of his skill in the medium. The publisher, Israël Henriet, another Frenchman from Nancy (born around 1590 and who lived until 1661 in Paris), ensured its distribution.

As the title suggests, this print depicts St. Bernardine of Siena, a significant figure, likely venerated on May 20th. The tag 'Saints' confirms this religious subject matter.

This etching, made in 1636, places it firmly within the Baroque period. It showcases Callot's detailed and precise style, despite its small size – only about 2 9/16 x 1 15/16 inches (6.5 x 5 cm). It's currently the second state of two, meaning there were slight variations made to the plate after the first printing.

You can find this particular print here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, a testament to Callot's enduring legacy as a master printmaker.""

","Alright, welcome! Let's take a closer look at this striking drawing.

This is *The Lawyer Paul Grand*, a portrait created in 1834 by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, a highly influential French artist who lived from 1780 to 1867. Ingres was a master of draftsmanship, known for his precise lines and idealized forms. He represents a bridge between Neoclassicism and Romanticism in French art.

This drawing, classified as a drawing and falling under the Drawings and Prints Department, depicts Paul Grand, a lawyer, evidenced by the tags of ""Men"" and ""Portraits"" associated with this artwork. Executed in graphite on wove paper with the watermark J. Whatman / Turkey Mill, it showcases Ingres's skill in rendering detail and capturing the likeness of his subject. The use of graphite allows for subtle gradations of tone, bringing depth and realism to the portrait.

Created in 1834, this artwork provides a glimpse into the world of 19th-century France, specifically the professional class. The size of the sheet is 13 1/2 x 10 1/4 inches (34.3 x 26 cm). You can find this drawing right here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

","Welcome! Let's take a closer look at this charming little print titled ""Pet Squirrel"" from the Household Pets series.

This piece was created in 1891 as a commercial color lithograph, meaning it wasn't intended as high art, but rather as a promotional item likely included in packs of tobacco produced by Wm. S. Kimball & Co. The lithography was done by Julius Bien & Co., a notable lithography firm of the time. The American Tobacco Company was also involved as a publisher.

Interestingly, one of the figures involved, Julius Bien, was born in Germany in 1826 and immigrated to the United States. He died in 1909. He exemplifies the influx of European talent contributing to the development of American commercial art during this period.

The subject matter is quite straightforward - a ""Pet Squirrel,"" and as you can see from the tags, it also features a woman. These images, depicting domestic scenes and animals, were popular choices for these types of promotional cards. It likely appealed to a wide audience, associating the tobacco brand with notions of domesticity, nature, and perhaps even a certain degree of refinement.

Given the 1891 date, this print offers a glimpse into the late 19th-century's burgeoning advertising industry and popular culture. The use of color lithography was becoming increasingly sophisticated, allowing for visually appealing and relatively inexpensive reproductions.

The print itself is quite small, measuring only about 3 3/4 by 2 1/2 inches (9.5 x 6.3 cm). You can find it here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, housed within the Department of Drawings and Prints as an example of ephemera - a transient item designed for a specific, often commercial, purpose. So, while not a fine art masterpiece, it provides a fascinating insight into the advertising strategies and artistic techniques of its time.

","""Welcome! Let's take a look at this etching by James McNeill Whistler, titled ""Windows, Bourges."" Whistler was an American artist, born in 1834 in Lowell, Massachusetts, and he lived until 1903, spending much of his career in London.

This print, created in 1888, belongs to the Drawings and Prints Department. As the title and tag ""Windows"" suggest, it depicts windows, most likely in the French town of Bourges. The etching captures a slice of life from that period.

Notice the technique; it's an etching, printed in black ink on buff laid paper. This particular impression is noted as the first state of two. The etching process involves using acid to create lines on a metal plate, which is then inked and printed. The print itself is quite small, the plate measuring about 5 3/4 by 3 1/8 inches. You can see the fine detail he achieved despite the small scale.

""Windows, Bourges,"" like other etchings by Whistler, demonstrates his interest in capturing atmospheric effects and everyday scenes. If you're interested in seeing more of his works, this piece is currently held in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art here in New York.""

","""Welcome! Let's take a closer look at this beautiful watercolor, 'Leith Hill from Broadmoor, Surrey.'

This drawing was created in 1860 by Edmund George Warren, a British artist born in London in 1834 and who passed away in 1909. Warren falls within the landscape art tradition of the mid-19th century, a period where artists were particularly interested in capturing the natural beauty of the British countryside.

As the title suggests, the artwork depicts Leith Hill, a prominent landmark in Surrey, England, as seen from Broadmoor. The tag 'landscapes' further reinforces the focus on natural scenery.

Warren employed a combination of watercolor, pen and ink, and gum arabic to create this piece. The watercolor provides delicate washes of color, while the pen and ink likely add finer details and definition. Gum arabic would have been used to enhance the luminosity and richness of the watercolor pigments. Its classification as a drawing highlights the importance of line and form in the artwork.

Kinney Brothers Tobacco Company, an American publisher active between 1869 and 2011, created it. While we don't have a detailed biography of the company itself, they were clearly engaged in the popular trend of using artwork for promotional purposes.

As you can see from the title and the tags, the print features a harp and, presumably, a woman playing it, aligning with the ""Novelties"" theme of the series. It’s fascinating to think about how Kinney Brothers used such images to market their tobacco products. The date, 1889, places it firmly within the late Victorian era, a period known for its increasing industrialization and burgeoning consumer culture.

The artwork is a commercial color lithograph, a popular printing technique at the time that allowed for mass production of vibrant images. Lithography involves printing from a stone or metal plate with a greasy image. Being classified as ""Prints and Ephemera"" indicates its original intended purpose was for widespread, temporary use, rather than high art.

Della Bella was known for his detailed and lively depictions of animals and scenes of everyday life. We also have Pierre Mariette listed as the publisher.

","""Welcome! Let's take a look at this fascinating print, *Schön newes Modelbuch (Page 60r)*.

This woodcut, created in 1608, is a page from a *Modelbuch* – essentially a pattern book - classified as Ornament & Architecture within the Books Prints Ornament & Architecture category. It was published by Sigismundus Latomus, a German artist active from 1599 until approximately 1627 and who died in 1632. These books were popular during this period for disseminating design ideas.

Given the title *Schön newes Modelbuch,* which translates to ""Beautiful New Pattern Book,"" and the ""Ornament"" tag, we can safely assume that this page presents a variety of decorative motifs intended for use in various crafts and architectural projects. Think of it as an early form of design inspiration, crucial for artisans and builders of the time.

This particular print, a woodcut, would have been relatively easily reproduced, allowing these patterns to spread quickly. The artwork itself is quite small, measuring only 4 1/2 x 6 11/16 inches (11.5 x 17 cm). You can see it here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.""

","Welcome! Let's take a look at this fascinating little piece.

This is a photograph titled ""Card 860, May Ten Broeck, from the Actors and Actresses series (N45, Type 2) for Virginia Brights Cigarettes."" It was produced circa 1888 by Allen & Ginter, an American publishing company based in Richmond, Virginia, active between 1885 and 1891.

As you can see from the title and tags, this photograph is part of a series featuring portraits of actresses. Such cards were incredibly popular ephemera at the time, often included as promotional items within cigarette packages. This specific example was part of the ""Actors and Actresses"" series and used to promote Virginia Brights Cigarettes. May Ten Broeck, the subject, was likely a stage actress.

The photograph itself is an albumen print, a popular photographic process during the late 19th century, and is considered both a photograph and a piece of ephemera. Note its small size, just 2 3/4 x 1 3/8 inches (7 x 3.5 cm). Despite its modest dimensions, it offers a glimpse into the world of entertainment and advertising of the late 1880s.

You can find this piece, a wonderful example of period portraiture and promotional material, here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

","Good morning! Welcome to this print, titled ""Racing,"" from October 20, 1811.

This artwork is a hand-colored etching, which falls under the classification of ""Prints."" It was created by the British artist Thomas Rowlandson, who lived from 1757 to 1827, and published by Thomas Tegg who lived from 1776 to 1846, both Londoners. Rowlandson was known for his satirical and often humorous depictions of British life.

As the title and tags ""Horses"" and ""Jockeys"" suggest, the subject matter of this print is horse racing. Considering the object date of 1811, it provides us with a glimpse into popular entertainment and sporting culture in early 19th-century Britain.

Technically, it's a hand-colored etching, meaning the image was etched onto a plate, printed, and then individually colored by hand. The plate itself measures 9 3/4 × 13 7/8 inches (24.8 × 35.3 cm), while the sheet is slightly larger. You can find this piece here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

","Good morning! Welcome! Let's take a closer look at this print, ""Battle Before Troy.""

This etching was created between 1535 and 1555. It's interesting because it's a collaborative piece, attributed to both Jean Mignon and Luca Penni. Mignon was a French artist active during this period, while Penni was an Italian artist originally from Florence who later moved to Paris. The differing artistic backgrounds might explain some of the piece's characteristics.

As the title suggests, the scene depicts a ""Battle Before Troy."" Looking at the tags, we can see it prominently features battles, weapons, men, and horses, all key components of the Trojan War narrative. The artwork reflects a continuing interest in classical themes during the Renaissance.

Being an etching, this print falls under the ""Prints"" classification. Etching involves using acid to cut into a metal plate, which is then inked and used to create the image.

This particular sheet, though trimmed, measures approximately 12 5/8 by 17 5/8 inches (32 x 44.7 cm).

And finally, this print is a part of the collection right here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York! It gives us a glimpse into the artistic trends and collaborative practices of 16th-century France and Italy. Any questions?

","""Welcome! Let's take a look at this fascinating little print. It's titled ""In the Nature of a Privilege, from the Snapshots from 'Puck' series"" and it dates back to 1888.

This isn't your typical high-art piece. It's a commercial color lithograph, essentially an advertisement produced by Knapp & Company, a lithographer, for W. Duke, Sons & Co., a publisher based out of both New York and Durham, North Carolina. Duke Sons & Co. was a tobacco company, and this print was part of a series they issued to promote their Honest Long Cut Tobacco. Both companies were American. Knapp's work spanned a period after 1870, while Duke was active later as well.

Notice the tags: ""Boys"" and ""Men"". The image, part of the ""Snapshots from 'Puck'"" series, likely depicts a scene involving men and boys, potentially within the context of the perceived 'privilege' of tobacco use. These were often distributed as collectible cards within tobacco packages.

The object date is important as it places this piece firmly within the late 19th century, a time of burgeoning mass production and the rise of advertising. Lithography, as a relatively inexpensive printing method, was key to reaching a wide audience. It's a piece of ephemera, meaning it was created for a specific, short-term purpose – in this case, selling tobacco – which makes its survival today all the more interesting.

It's quite small, only about 4 by 2 and a half inches (10.6 x 6.4 cm), so it's easy to miss, but its compact size speaks to its intended purpose as a collectible insert. You can see this example here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, a testament to its historical and cultural value beyond its initial commercial function.""

","Good morning! Welcome, and thank you for your interest in this charming print, ""Patience in a Punt.""

This delightful piece is a collaboration between two British artists: Thomas Rowlandson (1757-1827) and Henry William Bunbury (1750-1811). Bunbury, who sadly passed away the same year this print was created, was from Suffolk. Rowlandson, on the other hand, was a Londoner. Both were known for their satirical and humorous depictions of British life.

As you can gather from the title and tags like ""Fishing,"" ""Boats,"" and ""Men,"" this artwork portrays a scene of men fishing in a punt, a type of flat-bottomed boat often used in shallow waters. However, given the tag ""Satire,"" we can expect that the artists are presenting more than just a simple fishing scene. This probably offers a humorous commentary on the activity itself, or perhaps on the societal roles of the men depicted.

Created in 1811, this print gives us a glimpse into the popular visual culture of the early 19th century in Britain. It was a time when satirical prints were widely circulated and consumed as a form of social commentary.

Technically, this is a hand-colored etching and stipple print, a popular medium for printmaking during this period. Etching involves using acid to create lines on a metal plate, while stipple uses dots to create tonal variations. The addition of hand-coloring would have made each print slightly unique. It is classified as a Print.

The sheet itself measures approximately 9 15/16 by 14 1/2 inches (25.2 x 36.8 cm), and you can find it here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. I hope this gives you a better understanding of this intriguing work! Do you have any other questions?

","""Welcome! Let's take a look at this fascinating print entitled *Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae: Circus Flaminius*.

This print is an engraving created in 1553. It's quite large, measuring about 14 and a half by 21 and 7/8 inches. What you're seeing is a depiction of the Circus Flaminius in Rome. This piece is significant because it offers a glimpse into how people in the mid-16th century viewed and documented classical Roman architecture.

Now, regarding the artists involved: This was a collaborative effort. Nicolas Beatrizet, a French artist born in Lunéville in 1515, and active in Rome, is credited as the artist; Pirro Ligorio, an Italian artist from Naples, is also credited as an artist; and Michele Tramezzino, an Italian publisher active in Venice and Rome, played a key role in producing and distributing this image. Think of it as a collaborative team; Beatrizet created the engraving under the artistic direction of Ligorio, and Tramezzino printed and sold it.

As an engraving, the artwork belongs to the ""Prints"" classification, it was made using the painstaking process of incising an image onto a metal plate, inking it, and then transferring it to paper. It's a valuable record of architectural and historical importance and it resides here with us at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.""

","Good morning! Welcome to this captivating piece from our Drawings and Prints department.

This is a photograph titled ""Lillie Blow from the Actresses series (N203)"" issued by William S. Kimball & Co. back in 1889. While we don't have specific biographical information about William S. Kimball & Co., we know they functioned as a publisher, which puts this piece into a commercial context.

Looking at the title and tags, we understand that this is a portrait of an actress named Lillie Blow, part of a larger series featuring actresses. The late 19th century was a time of growing interest in celebrity culture, and these types of commercial photographs provided a way for people to connect with popular figures.

Technically, it's a commercial color lithograph, a process that allowed for mass production of images like this. While it's classified as both a photograph and ephemera, this highlights its dual nature - a photographic portrait reproduced through lithography for promotional or collectible purposes.

It’s quite a small piece, only 2 5/8 by 1 3/8 inches (6.6 x 3.5 cm), which likely means it was intended as a card or insert in a larger product. You can see it here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It gives us a glimpse into the entertainment world and popular culture of the late 1800s. What are your initial thoughts on the portrait?
