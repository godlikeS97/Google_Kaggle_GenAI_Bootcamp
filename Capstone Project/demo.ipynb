    "## Project Description\n",
    "This project implements an intelligent art gallery tour guide system using Large Language Models (LLMs) and computer vision capabilities. The system generates detailed, contextual explanations for artworks by combining structured metadata with visual analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Baseline Implementation**\n",
    "   - Developed a prompt engineering framework for artwork description generation using Gemini API\n",
    "   - Created structured prompts incorporating artwork metadata (artist info, historical context, physical details)\n",
    "   - Implemented a comprehensive evaluation framework with structured ratings (1-5 scale)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generation Control & Optimization**\n",
    "   - Implemented length control (200 tokens) for more concise explanations\n",
    "   - Analyzed the relationship between response length and quality ratings\n",
    "   - Monitored and evaluated generation quality across different length constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multimodal Integration**\n",
    "   - Enhanced the system with image processing capabilities using Gemini's multimodal features\n",
    "   - Combined textual metadata with visual analysis for richer artwork descriptions\n",
    "   - Developed a specialized prompt template that balances textual and visual information\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation Framework**\n",
    "   - Created a sophisticated evaluation system assessing multiple criteria:\n",
    "     - Instruction following\n",
    "     - Factual accuracy\n",
    "     - Artwork focus/relevance\n",
    "     - Analytical depth\n",
    "     - Clarity and cohesion\n",
    "     - Contextualization\n",
    "   - Implemented structured output for systematic quality assessment\n",
    "   - Analyzed bad generations to identify and address common issues\n"

    "4. Analytical Depth: The response goes beyond superficial description. It offers insights into technique, composition, symbolism, historical context, or artistic intent, demonstrating analytical thinking relevant to the identified artwork.\n",
    "5. Clarity and Cohesion: The explanation is well-organized, uses clear and understandable language, and flows logically.\n",
    "6. Contextualization: The response appropriately places the artwork within its relevant context (e.g., artist's life, art movement, historical period, cultural background) when necessary for understanding, based on the artwork identified in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rating Rubric\n",
    "5 (Very Good): Excels in all criteria. Accurate, insightful, highly relevant to the artwork in the prompt, clearly written, follows instructions perfectly, and provides strong context. Demonstrates a nuanced understanding.\n",
    "4 (Good): Strong performance. Accurate, relevant, and clear. Follows instructions well. May lack some analytical depth or contextual nuance compared to a top score, but is a solid explanation for the artwork in the prompt.\n",
    "3 (Ok): Acceptable explanation. Generally accurate and follows instructions but may be superficial, lack sufficient depth or context, have minor clarity issues, or include slightly irrelevant information. Gets the basics right for the artwork in the prompt but isn't particularly insightful.\n",
    "2 (Bad): Significant issues. Contains notable inaccuracies OR fails to follow key instructions OR is poorly focused/largely irrelevant to the artwork in the prompt OR is unclear/difficult to understand OR lacks necessary context/depth. (Note: If the prompt was too vague to identify an artwork, evaluate based on how the AI handled the ambiguity).\n",
    "1 (Very Bad): Fundamentally flawed. Contains major factual errors, completely ignores the prompt, is irrelevant to any reasonable interpretation of the artwork suggested by the prompt, is incoherent, or provides harmful/misleading information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Steps\n",
    "* STEP 1: Carefully read the user prompt to understand the request and identify the subject artwork based *only* on the prompt's content. Note any ambiguity in the prompt itself.\n",
    "* STEP 2: Read the AI-generated response.\n",
    "* STEP 3: Assess the response against each criterion: Instruction Following, Accuracy, Artwork Focus/Relevance, Analytical Depth, Clarity and Cohesion, and Contextualization, judging relevance and accuracy based on the artwork identified in Step 1.\n",
    "* STEP 4: Determine the overall quality and assign a rating from 1 to 5 based on the rubric, justifying your score with reference to the criteria and specific examples from the response. Acknowledge if prompt limitations impacted the possible response quality.\n",

       "'Welcome! Let\\'s take a look at this powerful print by Francisco de Goya, specifically Plate 11 from his series \"The Disasters of War,\" titled \"Neither do these\" or \"Ni por esas\" in Spanish.\\n\\nGoya was a Spanish artist, born in 1746 and passed away in 1828, with a long and impactful career spanning various political upheavals. This print, created around 1810, is part of a series reflecting the brutal realities of the Peninsular War, which saw Spain invaded and occupied by Napoleonic forces from around 1808 to 1814. The series as a whole is a searing indictment of war\\'s inhumanity.\\n\\nLooking at the tags - Soldiers, Infants, Men, Women - and the title, you can see the devastating impact of conflict on civilian populations. “Neither do these” implies that not even the most vulnerable—infants—are spared the horrors of war. Goya doesn\\'t shy away from portraying the raw, unvarnished truth.\\n\\nTechnically, this print is a \"working proof,\" meaning it was likely pulled while Goya was still developing the plate. It\\'s a combination of etching, drypoint, and burin, all intaglio techniques where the image is incised into a metal plate. The plate itself is relatively small, about 6 by 8 inches, while the sheet is around 8 by 12 inches.\\n\\n\"The Disasters of War\" is a significant series because it departs from traditional heroic depictions of war. Goya shows us the suffering, the violence, and the moral decay that accompanies armed conflict. This print, along with the rest of the series, offers a stark and enduring reminder of war\\'s devastating consequences. You can find this particular print, and many others from the series, here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Any questions?\\n'"

We can see from the title and the tags – horses, soldiers, men, and carriages – that it depicts a grand procession. Specifically, it shows a ceremonial entrance into Dresden, celebrating a royal marriage.\\n\\nThe artwork is a collaboration. The print was likely drawn by Adolf van der Laan (1684-1755), a Dutch artist, and Pieter Schenck II, who was born in 1693, served as the publisher. Van der Laan was from Amsterdam, which was a bustling hub of artistic production at the time.\\n\\nThe period it represents, the early 18th century, was a time of</td>\n",
       "      <td>## Evaluation\\n\\n### STEP 1: Understand the Prompt and Identify the Artwork\\nThe prompt provides detailed information about a print titled \"Entry of the Prince of Saxony with his Wife into Dresden on September 2, 1719, after their Marriage in Vienna,\" created around 1700-1755 by Adolf van der Laan and published by Pieter Schenck II. The prompt requests a concise explanation focusing on the artist's background, subject matter, historical significance, materials/techniques, size, and location.\\n\\n### STEP 2: Read the AI-Generated Response\\nThe AI response provides a starting explanation of the artwork, including its title, subject matter, and the artists involved. It also touches on the historical context and the artistic background of one of the artists. However, the response is incomplete and abruptly ends mid-sentence.\\n\\n### STEP 3: Assess the Response Against Each Criterion\\n\\n*   **Instruction Following:** The AI attempts to follow the instructions, addressing the artist's background, subject matter, and historical period, but it doesn't get through the materials/techniques, size, and location, likely due to the incomplete generation.\\n*   **Accuracy:** The information provided is accurate based on the data in the prompt.\\n*   **Artwork Focus/Relevance:** The explanation is directly relevant to the specified artwork.\\n*   **Analytical Depth:** The response starts to provide some historical context but doesn't delve deeply into the artwork's meaning or artistic techniques.\\n*   **Clarity and Cohesion:** The initial part of the explanation is clear and cohesive, but the abrupt ending disrupts the flow.\\n*   **Contextualization:** The response begins to contextualize the artwork by mentioning Amsterdam's artistic importance but doesn't fully develop this aspect.\\n\\n### STEP 4: Determine the Overall Quality and Assign a Rating\\n\\nDue to the response being incomplete and abruptly cut off, the overall quality is significantly diminished. While the initial part of the response is good and addresses several aspects of the prompt, the lack of a complete explanation and the omission of key details mentioned in the prompt (dimensions and repository) leads to a low rating.\\n\\n**Rating: 2 (Bad)**\\n\\n**Explanation:**\\n\\nThe response contains a significant issue as it is incomplete.

The artwork is a design drawing for a sofa back cover, created by an anonymous French artist in the late 19th century. The response should cover the artist's background, subject matter, historical significance, materials/techniques, size, and location.\\n\\n### STEP 2: Read the AI-Generated Response\\nThe AI provides an initial welcome and identifies the artwork. It notes the anonymous artist and the potential purpose of the design. The response is cut off at the end of the second paragraph.\\n\\n### STEP 3: Assess the Response\\n*   **Instruction Following:** The response starts well, addressing the provided details. It successfully mentions the artist's anonymity, nationality, and date range, as well as the title and potential subject matter. However, because the response is cut off, it doesn't fully address all the instructions. It does not include the material and techniques used, its size or its location.\\n*   **Accuracy:** The information provided is accurate based on the prompt.\\n*   **Artwork Focus/Relevance:** The explanation focuses on the identified artwork.\\n*   **Analytical Depth:** The response starts to offer some context regarding the late 19th century and its decorative arts, but it's cut short.\\n*   **Clarity and Cohesion:** The explanation is clear and well-organized so far.\\n*   **Contextualization:** The response begins to contextualize the artwork within its historical period.\\n\\n### STEP 4: Determine the Overall Quality and Assign a Rating\\nDue to the incomplete nature of the response, the rating is capped.

Nicolas Beatrizet, a French artist born in Lunéville in 1515, and active in Rome, is credited as an artist on this piece. His work is joined by Pirro Ligorio, an Italian artist from Naples, who also contributed to the work.

The AI is instructed to act as a tour guide and focus on artist background, subject matter, historical period, materials/techniques, size, and location.\\n\\n### STEP 2: Read the AI-Generated Response\\nThe AI-generated response provides an introduction to the print, identifies the Circus Flaminius as the subject, and mentions the artists involved. It also notes the medium and collaborative nature of the print. However, the response is incomplete as it cuts off mid-sentence.\\n\\n### STEP 3: Assess the Response Against Each Criterion\\n\\n*   **Instruction Following:** Partially follows instructions. It starts addressing the requested points but doesn't complete them due to the truncation.\\n*   **Accuracy:** The information provided is accurate based on the provided details.\\n*   **Artwork Focus/Relevance:** The explanation is relevant to the artwork identified in the prompt.\\n*   **Analytical Depth:** Lacks analytical depth due to the incomplete nature of the response.\\n*   **Clarity and Cohesion:** The beginning of the response is clear and cohesive, but it abruptly ends.\\n*   **Contextualization:** Touches upon contextualization by mentioning the grandeur of ancient Rome but doesn't fully develop this.\\n\\n### STEP 4: Determine the Overall Quality and Assign a Rating\\n\\nGiven that the response is incomplete, it's difficult to give it a high rating. While the information presented is accurate and relevant, the lack of completion significantly hinders its overall quality. I will rate it a 2 (Bad) due to the significant issue of being incomplete.

Let's take a closer look at this fascinating print.\\n\\nThis is an etching titled \"Entry of the Prince of Saxony with his Wife into Dresden on September 2, 1719, after their Marriage in Vienna.\" It was created sometime between 1700 and 1755. We can see from the title and the tags – horses, soldiers, men, and carriages – that it depicts a grand procession. Specifically, it shows a ceremonial entrance into Dresden, celebrating a royal marriage.\\n\\nThe artwork is a collaboration. The print was likely drawn by Adolf van der Laan (1684-1755), a Dutch artist, and Pieter Schenck II, who was born in 1693, served as the publisher. Van der Laan was from Amsterdam, which was a bustling hub of artistic production at the time.\\n\\nThe period it represents, the early 18th century, was a time of   \n",

Today, I'd like to draw your attention to this fascinating piece entitled \"Design for a Sofa Back Cover (?) with an Ornamental Frame Containing a Large Horizontal Garland of Flowers and Leaves with Musical Instruments and a Vase, Decorated with Acanthus Leaves and Two Fleurs de Lys.\"\\n\\nUnfortunately, the artist is currently listed as \"Anonymous, French, 19th century,\" so we don't have a specific name to associate with this work. We know they were working in France sometime between 1800 and 1900, designing objects such as this potential sofa back cover.\\n\\nThe object itself is dated between 1870 and 1900, giving us a window into the late 19th century, a period known for its opulent interiors and decorative arts. The title gives us a good idea of the subject matter. It’s a design, likely for a textile, meant to adorn   \n",

Let me draw your attention to this fascinating print titled \"Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae: Circus Flaminius.\"\\n\\nThis engraving, created in 1553, gives us a glimpse into the grandeur of ancient Rome. It depicts the Circus Flaminius, a significant architectural landmark of the time, dedicated to public games and events. You can see that it's tagged with both \"Architecture\", \"Circus\" and \"Rome\", giving a good sense of what to expect from it.\\n\\nThe print is a collaborative effort. Nicolas Beatrizet, a French artist born in Lunéville in 1515, and active in Rome, is credited as an artist on this piece. His work is joined by Pirro Ligorio, an Italian artist from Naples, who also contributed to the work.

The prompt requests a concise explanation focusing on the artist's background, subject matter, historical significance, materials/techniques, size, and location.\\n\\n### STEP 2: Read the AI-Generated Response\\nThe AI response provides a starting explanation of the artwork, including its title, subject matter, and the artists involved. It also touches on the historical context and the artistic background of one of the artists. However, the response is incomplete and abruptly ends mid-sentence.\\n\\n### STEP 3: Assess the Response Against Each Criterion\\n\\n*   **Instruction Following:** The AI attempts to follow the instructions, addressing the artist's background, subject matter, and historical period, but it doesn't get through the materials/techniques, size, and location, likely due to the incomplete generation.\\n*   **Accuracy:** The information provided is accurate based on the data in the prompt.\\n*   **Artwork Focus/Relevance:** The explanation is directly relevant to the specified artwork.\\n*   **Analytical Depth:** The response starts to provide some historical context but doesn't delve deeply into the artwork's meaning or artistic techniques.\\n*   **Clarity and Cohesion:** The initial part of the explanation is clear and cohesive, but the abrupt ending disrupts the flow.\\n*   **Contextualization:** The response begins to contextualize the artwork by mentioning Amsterdam's artistic importance but doesn't fully develop this aspect.\\n\\n### STEP 4: Determine the Overall Quality and Assign a Rating\\n\\nDue to the response being incomplete and abruptly cut off, the overall quality is significantly diminished. While the initial part of the response is good and addresses several aspects of the prompt, the lack of a complete explanation and the omission of key details mentioned in the prompt (dimensions and repository) leads to a low rating.\\n\\n**Rating: 2 (Bad)**\\n\\n**Explanation:**\\n\\nThe response contains a significant issue as it is incomplete.

The artwork is a design drawing for a sofa back cover, created by an anonymous French artist in the late 19th century. The response should cover the artist's background, subject matter, historical significance, materials/techniques, size, and location.\\n\\n### STEP 2: Read the AI-Generated Response\\nThe AI provides an initial welcome and identifies the artwork. It notes the anonymous artist and the potential purpose of the design. The response is cut off at the end of the second paragraph.\\n\\n### STEP 3: Assess the Response\\n*   **Instruction Following:** The response starts well, addressing the provided details. It successfully mentions the artist's anonymity, nationality, and date range, as well as the title and potential subject matter. However, because the response is cut off, it doesn't fully address all the instructions. It does not include the material and techniques used, its size or its location.\\n*   **Accuracy:** The information provided is accurate based on the prompt.\\n*   **Artwork Focus/Relevance:** The explanation focuses on the identified artwork.\\n*   **Analytical Depth:** The response starts to offer some context regarding the late 19th century and its decorative arts, but it's cut short.\\n*   **Clarity and Cohesion:** The explanation is clear and well-organized so far.\\n*   **Contextualization:** The response begins to contextualize the artwork within its historical period.\\n\\n### STEP 4: Determine the Overall Quality and Assign a Rating\\nDue to the incomplete nature of the response, the rating is capped. While it correctly identifies the artwork and begins to address the instructions, it fails to deliver a complete explanation as requested.\\n\\n**Rating: 2 (Bad)**\\n\\n**Explanation:** The response is incomplete and fails to fully address the instructions due to being cut off. While the information presented is accurate and relevant, the lack of a complete explanation warrants a \"Bad\" rating.\\n  \n",

The AI is instructed to act as a tour guide and focus on artist background, subject matter, historical period, materials/techniques, size, and location.\\n\\n### STEP 2: Read the AI-Generated Response\\nThe AI-generated response provides an introduction to the print, identifies the Circus Flaminius as the subject, and mentions the artists involved. It also notes the medium and collaborative nature of the print. However, the response is incomplete as it cuts off mid-sentence.\\n\\n### STEP 3: Assess the Response Against Each Criterion\\n\\n*   **Instruction Following:** Partially follows instructions. It starts addressing the requested points but doesn't complete them due to the truncation.\\n*   **Accuracy:** The information provided is accurate based on the provided details.\\n*   **Artwork Focus/Relevance:** The explanation is relevant to the artwork identified in the prompt.\\n*   **Analytical Depth:** Lacks analytical depth due to the incomplete nature of the response.\\n*   **Clarity and Cohesion:** The beginning of the response is clear and cohesive, but it abruptly ends.\\n*   **Contextualization:** Touches upon contextualization by mentioning the grandeur of ancient Rome but doesn't fully develop this.\\n\\n### STEP 4: Determine the Overall Quality and Assign a Rating\\n\\nGiven that the response is incomplete, it's difficult to give it a high rating. While the information presented is accurate and relevant, the lack of completion significantly hinders its overall quality. I will rate it a 2 (Bad) due to the significant issue of being incomplete. Had the response not been cut off, it would have likely scored higher.\\n  "

Goya was a significant figure, witnessing immense social and political upheaval during his lifetime. This particular print, titled \"Neither do these\" ('Ni por esas'), was created around 1810, placing it squarely within the period of the Peninsular War. The whole series created between 1805 and 1815, is a direct response to the brutality and devastation he witnessed during this conflict.\n",

The image is a stark depiction of the atrocities inflicted upon the civilian population during the war.\n",
      "\n",
      "Goya employed etching, drypoint, and burin techniques to create this print. This combination of methods allowed him to achieve a range of tonal effects, from the deep, rich blacks in the shadows to the delicate, scratchy lines that define the figures. You can appreciate the contrasts and textures that create a dramatic and emotionally charged scene. The plate size of the print is approximately 6 5/16 × 8 3/8 inches (16.1 × 21.2 cm), while the sheet size is 8 3/8 × 12 3/4 inches (21.3 × 32.4 cm).\n",

       "'Welcome! Let\\'s take a look at this powerful print by Francisco de Goya, specifically Plate 11 from his series \"The Disasters of War,\" titled \"Neither do these\" or \"Ni por esas\" in Spanish.\\n\\nGoya was a Spanish artist, born in 1746 and passed away in 1828, with a long and impactful career spanning various political upheavals. This print, created around 1810, is part of a series reflecting the brutal realities of the Peninsular War, which saw Spain invaded and occupied by Napoleonic forces from around 1808 to 1814. The series as a whole is a searing indictment of war\\'s inhumanity.\\n\\nLooking at the tags - Soldiers, Infants, Men, Women - and the title, you can see the devastating impact of conflict on civilian populations. “Neither do these” implies that not even the most vulnerable—infants—are spared the horrors of war. Goya doesn\\'t shy away from portraying the raw, unvarnished truth.\\n\\nTechnically, this print is a \"working proof,\" meaning it was likely pulled while Goya was still developing the plate. It\\'s a combination of etching, drypoint, and burin, all intaglio techniques where the image is incised into a metal plate. The plate itself is relatively small, about 6 by 8 inches, while the sheet is around 8 by 12 inches.\\n\\n\"The Disasters of War\" is a significant series because it departs from traditional heroic depictions of war. Goya shows us the suffering, the violence, and the moral decay that accompanies armed conflict. This print, along with the rest of the series, offers a stark and enduring reminder of war\\'s devastating consequences. You can find this particular print, and many others from the series, here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Any questions?\\n'"

      "0    Welcome! Let's take a look at this powerful print.\\n\\nThis is \"Plate 11 from 'The Disasters of War': 'Neither do these'\" by Francisco de Goya. Goya was a Spanish artist born in 1746 and died in 1828. He was a prominent figure in Spanish art, witnessing and reacting to significant historical events of his time.\\n\\nThis particular print, created around 1810 and 1815, is part of a series depicting the brutal realities of the Peninsular War (1808-1814). The series is a stark commentary on the atrocities committed during the conflict.\\n\\nLooking at the image, we can see the artist's focus on the impact of war on civilians. The soldiers, men, women, and even infants are the tags for this picture. The title \"Neither do these\" along with the image indicates a scene of cruelty and suffering inflicted upon innocents.\\n\\nTechnically, this print is a working proof, realized using etching, drypoint, and burin techniques. You can see how Goya uses these methods to create strong contrasts of light and shadow, adding to the dramatic intensity of the scene. The plate measures 6 5/16 × 8 3/8 inches, while the sheet is 8 3/8 × 12 3/4 inches.\\n\\nThis print is currently part of the Drawings and Prints collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, NY, and it serves as a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and Goya's unflinching artistic vision.\\n\n",

    "You are an expert evaluator, knowledgeable in art history and visual analysis. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses generated by AI models that provide explanations for artworks, using a **primary text prompt** and a **supplementary image input**.\n",
    "We will provide you with the user's inputs (the primary text prompt and the supplementary image) and the AI-generated response.\n",
    "You should first **read the primary text prompt carefully** to understand the core task and requirements. Then, examine the supplementary image to understand the visual context provided. Your evaluation should focus on how well the AI addresses the **primary text prompt**, assessing if and how effectively it utilizes the **supplementary image for relevant illustration, evidence, or visual grounding**.\n",
    "You will assign the response a rating following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps. Provide a step-by-step explanation for your rating, referencing specific parts of the response, the text prompt, and visual details **if the image was appropriately used**. Only choose ratings from the Rating Rubric.\n",

    "You will be assessing **Artwork Explanation Quality (Text-Primary + Image-Auxiliary)**. This measures the AI's ability to provide an accurate, insightful, relevant, and clear explanation that **primarily addresses the requirements of the text prompt**. It also assesses the AI's ability to **appropriately and accurately integrate relevant details from the supplementary image** to enhance or support the explanation, without being unduly distracted by irrelevant visual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Criteria\n",
    "* **Instruction Following (Text Prompt)**: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the **primary text prompt** and directly addresses its core requirements (e.g., specific question, focus, theme, audience). **This is the most important criterion.**\n",
    "* **Accuracy (Factual & Visual)**: Information presented related to the text prompt's subject is factually correct. **When visual details from the image are referenced** to support the explanation, those descriptions must accurately reflect the supplementary image.\n",
    "* **Relevant Visual Support**: When the explanation references the supplementary image, the visual details mentioned are **directly relevant to the points being made in response to the text prompt**. The response uses the image effectively as support where appropriate, without letting tangential visual details derail the main focus set by the text prompt. Assesses if the image *enhances* the answer to the text prompt.\n",
    "* **Analytical Depth (Text-Focused)**: The response offers insights (e.g., into technique, symbolism, context, intent) that are relevant to the **focus defined by the text prompt**. Visual details from the image may be used effectively as evidence or illustration for this analysis.\n",
    "* **Clarity and Cohesion**: The explanation is well-organized, uses clear language appropriate for the audience specified or implied in the text prompt, and flows logically, focusing on answering the text prompt.\n",
    "* **Contextualization (Prompt-Driven)**: Provides relevant context (artist, period, etc.) that aids in understanding the topic raised in the **text prompt**. May connect this context to the image if relevant to the explanation.\n",

    "## Rating Rubric\n",
    "* **5 (Very Good)**: Perfectly addresses the **text prompt** with accuracy, depth, and clarity. **Skillfully and relevantly integrates details from the supplementary image** to effectively support or illustrate the points made. Excels in all criteria, demonstrating mastery of the text task enhanced by the image.\n",
    "* **4 (Good)**: Strongly addresses the **text prompt** accurately and clearly. **Uses the image appropriately and accurately** for relevant support, though perhaps less insightfully or seamlessly than a 5. A solid response primarily focused on the text prompt.\n",
    "* **3 (Ok)**: Acceptably addresses the main points of the **text prompt**, but may be somewhat superficial, lack depth, or have minor clarity issues. **Uses the image, but potentially in a limited, slightly irrelevant, or non-insightful way**, or with minor visual inaccuracies. Gets the basics of the text prompt right.\n",
    "* **2 (Bad)**: **Significant issues addressing the text prompt** (major inaccuracies, instruction failure, lack of focus) OR **significantly misuses, misinterprets, or irrelevantly focuses on the image** instead of using it as support for the text prompt. Fails on key aspects of the primary task.\n",
    "* **1 (Very Bad)**: Fundamentally fails to address the **text prompt** OR relies on major factual/visual errors or hallucinations related to the core task. **Ignores the text prompt's focus in favor of the image, or completely misuses the image** context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Steps\n",
    "* STEP 1: Carefully read the **primary text prompt** to fully understand the core request and its constraints.\n",
    "* STEP 2: Examine the **supplementary image** to understand the visual context provided.\n",
    "* STEP 3: Read the AI-generated response.\n",
    "* STEP 4: Assess how well the response addresses the **text prompt** based on Instruction Following, Accuracy (factual), Analytical Depth, Contextualization, and Clarity.\n",
    "* STEP 5: Evaluate **how effectively and accurately the supplementary image was used** based on Relevant Visual Support and Accuracy (visual). Consider if the image use enhanced the answer to the text prompt or distracted from it.\n",
    "* STEP 6: Determine the overall quality, **giving primary weight to how well the text prompt was addressed (Step 4)**, while factoring in the appropriate use of the image (Step 5). Assign a rating from 1 to 5 based on the rubric, justifying your score.\n",

I must use the text details as the main source of information and use the image for visual context. The explanation should include the artist's background, the artwork's subject matter, the historical period and significance, the materials and techniques used, and its size and location. The core facts should come from the text, but the description can be enriched with observations from the image.\n",
