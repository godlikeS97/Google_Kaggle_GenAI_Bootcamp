Task Aware Embedding

### üåü Short Answer:

Although the model is only **doing inference**, it can **generate different embeddings for the same input** based on the specified `task_type` because it has **learned how to ‚Äúinterpret‚Äù inputs differently for different tasks during training**. This is not fine-tuning ‚Äî the model isn‚Äôt learning ‚Äî but rather switching its ‚Äúway of thinking‚Äù based on the task type.

### üß† More Detailed Explanation:

Modern embedding models (like `text-embedding-004`) typically rely on two key mechanisms:

#### 1. **Multi-task Training**

- During training, the model is exposed to data from **multiple tasks** (e.g., retrieval, classification, similarity scoring).
- It learns a **shared encoder** that can generate useful representations across tasks.
- Crucially, it also learns to **adjust its encoding style depending on the task**.

#### 2. **Task Prompting**

- The `task_type` you specify is often turned into a **special prompt token** prepended to the input text, such as:

  ```
  csharp
  
  
  
  [RETRIEVAL_QUERY] What causes global warming?
  [CLASSIFICATION] What causes global warming?
  ```

- These task-specific tokens were also used during training, so the model **learns to interpret the same input differently depending on the task prompt**.

> Just like humans understand the same sentence differently in different contexts, the model uses learned ‚Äúcontext-awareness‚Äù to adjust how it embeds the text.

### üß™ Example:

Take the sentence:

```
css



"Apple is looking to buy a UK startup."
```

The resulting embedding will differ depending on the task:

| `task_type`          | What the embedding focuses on                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `RETRIEVAL_QUERY`    | User intent, key terms for matching             |
| `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT` | Full context and completeness of information    |
| `CLASSIFICATION`     | Signals for topic, tone, or label-worthy traits |
| `FACT_VERIFICATION`  | Entity relationships, factual structure         |

So while the input is the same, the embeddings differ because the model adjusts its representation to match the goal of the task.
